1. server should remember to which client to send response.
Now I get error when I send response to client that didn't provide me this message.
 
2. Is correlation id unique between all clients? 
 
---------------

1. create correct design and implement it															TODO

- e.g. with Connections and ConnectionManager where we can have different implementations of Connection, e.g. for testing

	- what is interface of ConnectionManager ?
	
	- what is interface of Connection ?
	
	- use methods of ConnectionManager, Connection from interface
	
	- io classes must not depend on MyServer.
	MyServer is just coordinator 


- split classes to client and server packages

Relation between Message and Connection
correlationId is not enough because it is not unique

solutions:
1. generate serverCorrelationId - No

2. Message should have reference to Connection
one connection handles multiple input and output messages 



 
 
----------- Hazelcast

ConnectionManager has several in and out selectors

e.g. see MapGetRequest



WriteHandler (implements SelectionHandler) has 1 to 1 to Connection

- server reading part

	ClientRequest
	CallableClientRequest

	ClientEngineImpl
		#handlePacket
		
- server writing part:
	WriteHandler writes Packet
